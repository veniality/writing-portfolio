# About me

Hello! My name is Elysa Hall.

I'm a Technical Writer with experience writing documentation for IT departments, Google products, and AWS services in the Greater Seattle Area of Washington state. Specifically I write content that helps people resolve their technology issues so they can focus on their priorities.

**I strongly believe that if something is not written down, it does no exist.** Solutions, features, and processes whether internal or external should be written in a concise and informative matter so people can access the knowledge.

I have an additional background in art, IT helpdesk services and creating/leading trainings, which provides me a creative approach to tackling things for a solution.

In my spare time I enjoy drawing, reading, playing video games, and dabbing in game development primarily in the Godot 4 engine.

I'd love to hear from you! [Reach out to me](contact.html).
