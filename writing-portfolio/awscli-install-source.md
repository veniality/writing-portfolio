## Why build from source?

The AWS CLI is [available as pre-built installers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for most platforms and environments as well as a Docker image.

Generally, these installers provide coverage for most use-cases. The instructions for installing from source are to help with the use-cases our installers do not cover. Some of these use-cases include the following:

* The pre-built installers do not support your environment. For example, ARM 32-bit is not supported by the pre-built installers.

* The pre-built installers have dependencies your environment lacks. For example, Alpine Linux uses [`musl`](https://musl.libc.org/), but the current installers require `glibc` causing the pre-built installers to not immediately work.

* The pre-built installers require resources your environment restricts access to. For example, security hardened systems might not give permissions to shared memory. This is needed for the frozen `aws` installer.

* The pre-built installers are often blockers for maintainers in package managers, as full control over the building process for code and packages is preferred. Building from source enables distribution maintainers a more streamlined process to keep the AWS CLI updated. Enabling maintainers provides customers more up-to-date versions of the AWS CLI when installing from a 3rd party package manager such as `brew`, `yum`, and `apt`.

* Customers that patch AWS CLI functionality require building and installing the AWS CLI from source. This is especially important for community members that want to test changes they've made to the source prior to contributing the change to the AWS CLI GitHub repository.

## Quicksteps

{: .note }
> All code examples are assumed to run from the root of the source directory.

To build and install the AWS CLI from source, follow the steps in this section. The AWS CLI leverages [GNU Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/faq/autotools-faq.html) to install from source. In the simplest case, the AWS CLI can be installed from source by running the default example commands from the root of the AWS CLI GitHub repository.

1. Setup all requirements for your environment. This includes being able to run GNU Autotools generated files and Python 3.8 or later is installed.

1. In your terminal, navigate to the top level of the AWS CLI source folder and run the ./configure command. This command checks the system for all required dependencies and generates a Makefile for building and installing the AWS CLI based on detected and specified configurations.

<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Linux and macOS
  </summary>

  The following `./configure` command example sets the build configuration for the AWS CLI using default settings.

  ```sh
    ./configure
  ```
</details>

<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Windows PowerShell
  </summary>

  Before running any commands calling MSYS2, you must preserve your current working directory:

  ```ps
    $env:CHERE_INVOKING = 'yes'
  ```

  Then use the following `./configure` command example to set the build configuration for the AWS CLI using your local path to your Python executable, installing to `C:\Program Files\AWSCLI`, and downloading all dependencies.

  ```ps
    C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash  -lc " PYTHON='C:\path\to\p
  ```
</details>

For details, available configuration options, and default setting information, see the (Step 2: Configuring the AWS CLI source installation)[] section.


1. Run the make command. This command builds the AWS CLI according to your configuration settings.

The following make command example builds with default options using your existing ./configure settings.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ make
For details and available build options, see the Step 3: Building the AWS CLI section.

1. Run the make install command. This command installs your built AWS CLI to the configured location on your system.

The following make install command example installs your built AWS CLI and creates symlinks in your configured locations using default command settings.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ make install
For details and available install options, see the Step 4: Installing the AWS CLI section.

1. Confirm the AWS CLI successfully installed using the following command:


$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
For troubleshooting steps for install errors see the Troubleshooting AWS CLI install and uninstall errors section.

## Step 1: Setup all requirements

To build the AWS CLI from source you need the following completed beforehand:

Note
All code examples are assumed to run from the root of the source directory.

Download the AWS CLI source by either forking the AWS CLI GitHub repository or downloading the source tarball. The instructions is one of the following:

Fork and clone the AWS CLI repository from GitHub. For more information, see Fork a repo in the GitHub Docs.

Download the latest source tarball at https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli.tar.gz extract the contents using the following commands:


$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli.tar.gz" -o "awscli.tar.gz"
$ tar -xzf awscli.tar.gz
Note
To download a specific version, use the following link format: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-versionnumber.tar.gz

For example, for version 2.10.0 the link is the following: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-2.10.0.tar.gz

Source versions are available starting with version 2.10.0 of the AWS CLI.

(Optional) Verifying the integrity of your downloaded zip file by completing the following steps:

You can use the following steps to verify the signatures by using the GnuPG tool.

The AWS CLI installer package .zip files are cryptographically signed using PGP signatures. If there is any damage or alteration of the files, this verification fails and you should not proceed with installation.

Download and install the gpg command using your package manager. For more information about GnuPG, see the GnuPG website.

To create the public key file, create a text file and paste in the following text.

The warning in the output is expected and doesn't indicate a problem. It occurs because there isn't a chain of trust between your personal PGP key (if you have one) and the AWS CLI PGP key. For more information, see Web of trust.

Show more
You have an environment that can run GNU Autotools generated files such as configure and Makefile. These files are widely portable across POSIX platforms.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell
If Autotools is not already installed in your environment or you need to update them, then follow the installation instructions found in How do I install the Autotools (as user)? or Basic Installation in the GNU documentation.

A Python 3.8 or later interpreter is installed. The minimum Python version required follows the same timelines as the official Python support policy for AWS SDKs and Tools. An interpreter is only supported 6 months after its end-of-support date.

(Optional) Install all build and runtime Python library dependencies of the AWS CLI. The ./configure command informs you if you are missing any dependencies and how to install them.

You can automatically install and use these dependencies through configuration, see Downloading dependencies for more information.

Step 2: Configuring the AWS CLI source installation

Configuration for building and installing the AWS CLI is specified using the configure script. For the documentation of all configuration options, run the configure script with the --help option:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ ./configure --help
The most important options are the following:
Install location

Python interpreter

Downloading dependencies

Install type

Install location
The source installation of the AWS CLI uses two configurable directories to install the AWS CLI:

libdir - Parent directory where the AWS CLI will be installed. The path to the AWS CLI installation is <libdir-value>/aws-cli. The default libdir value for Linux and macOS is /usr/local/lib making the default installation directory /usr/local/lib/aws-cli

bindir - Directory where the AWS CLI executables are installed. The default location is /usr/local/bin.

The following configure options control the directories used:

--prefix - Sets the directory prefix to use for the installation. The default value for Linux and macOS is /usr/local.

--libdir - Sets the libdir to use for installing the AWS CLI. The default value is <prefix-value>/lib. If both --libdir and --prefix are not specified, the default for Linux and macOS is /usr/local/lib/.

--bindir - Sets the bindir to use for installing the AWS CLI aws and aws_completer executables. The default value is <prefix-value>/bin. If both bindir and --prefix are not specified, the default for Linux and macOS is /usr/local/bin/.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell
The following command example uses the --prefix option to do a local user install of the AWS CLI. This command installs the AWS CLI in $HOME/.local/lib/aws-cli and the executables in $HOME/.local/bin:


$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
The following command example uses the --libdir option to install the AWS CLI as an add-on application in the /opt directory. This command installs the AWS CLI at /opt/aws-cli and the executables at their default location of /usr/local/bin.


$ ./configure --libdir=/opt
Python interpreter
Note
It is highly recommended to specify the Python interpreter when installing for Windows.

The ./configure script automatically selects an installed Python 3.8 or later interpreter to use in building and running the AWS CLI using the AM_PATH_PYTHON Autoconf macro.

The Python interpreter to use can be explicitly set using the PYTHON environment variable when running the configure script:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ PYTHON=/path/to/python ./configure
Downloading dependencies
By default, it is required that all build and runtime dependencies of the AWS CLI are already installed on the system. This includes any Python library dependencies. All dependencies are checked when the configure script is run, and if the system is missing any Python dependencies, the configure script errors out.

The following code example errors out when your system is missing dependencies:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ ./configure

validate_env.UnmetDependenciesException: Environment requires following Python dependencies:

awscrt (required: ('>=0.12.4', '<0.17.0')) (version installed: None)

We recommend using --with-download-deps flag to automatically create a virtualenv and download the dependencies.

If you want to manage the dependencies yourself instead, run the following pip command:
/Users/username/.envs/env3.11/bin/python -m pip install --prefer-binary 'awscrt>=0.12.4,<0.17.0'

configure: error: "Python dependencies not met."
To automatically install the required Python dependencies, use the --with-download-deps option. When using this flag, the build process does the following:

Skips the Python library dependencies check.

Configures the settings to download all required Python dependencies and use only the downloaded dependencies to build the AWS CLI during the make build.

The following configure command example uses the --with-download-deps option to download and use the Python dependencies:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ ./configure --with-download-deps
Install type
The source install process supports the following installation types:

system-sandbox - (Default) Creates an isolated Python virtual environment, installs the AWS CLI into the virtual environment, and symlinks to the aws and aws_completer executable in the virtual environment. This install of the AWS CLI depends directly on the selected Python interpreter for its runtime.

This is a lightweight install mechanism to get the AWS CLI installed on a system and follows best Python practices by sandboxing the installation in a virtual environment. This installation is intended for customers that want to install the AWS CLI from source in the most frictionless way possible with the installation coupled to your installation of Python.

portable-exe - Freezes the AWS CLI into a standalone executable that can be distributed to environments of similar architectures. This is the same process used to generate the official pre-built executables of the AWS CLI. The portable-exe freezes in a copy of the Python interpreter chosen in the configure step to use for the runtime of the AWS CLI. This allows it to be moved to other machines that may not have a Python interpreter.

This type of builds is useful because you can ensure your AWS CLI installation isn't coupled to the environment's installed Python version and you can distribute a build to other system that may not already have Python installed. This enables you to control the dependencies and security on the AWS CLI executables you use.

To configure the installation type, use the --with-install-type option and specify a value of portable-exe or system-sandbox.

The following ./configure command example specifies a value of portable-exe:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ ./configure --with-install-type=portable-exe
Step 3: Building the AWS CLI

Use the make command to build the AWS CLI using your configuration settings:


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell

$ make
Note
When using the make command, the following steps are completed behind the scenes:
A virtual environment is created in the build directory using the Python venv module. The virtual environment is bootstraped with a version of pip that is vendored in the Python standard library.

Copies Python library dependencies. Depending on if the --with-download-deps flag is specified in the configure command, this step does one of the following:

The --with-download-deps is specified. Python dependencies are pip installed. This includes wheel, setuptools, and all AWS CLI runtime dependencies. If you are building the portable-exe, pyinstaller is installed. These requirements are all specified in lock files generated from pip-compile.

The --with-download-deps is not specified. Python libraries from the Python interpreter's site package plus any scripts (e.g. pyinstaller) are copied into the virtual environment being used for the build.

Runs pip install directly on the AWS CLI codebase to do an offline, in-tree build and install of the AWS CLI into the build virtual environment. This install uses the pip flags --no-build-isolation , --use-feature=in-tree-build , --no-cache-dir , and --no-index.

(Optional) If the --install-type is set to portable-exe in the configure command, builds a standalone executable using pyinstaller.

Step 4: Installing the AWS CLI

The make install command installs your built AWS CLI to the configured location on the system.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell
The following command example installs the AWS CLI using your configuration and build settings:


$ make install
The make install rule supports the DESTDIR variable. When specified, this variable prefixes the specified path to the already configured installation path when installing the AWS CLI. By default, no value is set for this variable.


Linux and macOS

Windows PowerShell
The following code example uses a --prefix=/usr/local flag for configuring an install location, and then alters that destination using DESTDIR=/tmp/stage for the make install command. These commands result in the AWS CLI being installed at /tmp/stage/usr/local/lib/aws-cli and its executables located in /tmp/stage/usr/local/bin.


$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install
Note
When running make install, the following steps are completed behind the scenes
Moves one of the following to the configured install directory:

If the install type is system-sandbox, moves your built virtual environment.

If the install type is a portable-exe, moves your built standalone executable.

Creates symlinks for both the aws and aws_completer executables in your configured bin directory.

Show more
Step 5: Verifying the AWS CLI installation

Confirm the AWS CLI successfully installed by using the following command:


$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
If the aws command is not recognized, you may need to restart your terminal for new symlinks to update. If you come across additional issues after installing or uninstalling the AWS CLI, see Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI for common troubleshooting steps

Workflow examples

This section provides some basic workflow examples for installing from source.

Basic Linux and macOS install
The following example is a basic installation workflow where the AWS CLI is installed in the default location of /usr/local/lib/aws-cli.


$ cd path/to/cli/respository/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
Automated Windows install
Note
You must run PowerShell as an Administrator to use this workflow.

MSYS2 can be used in an automated fashion in a CI setting, see Using MSYS2 in CI in the MSYS2 Documentation.


Downloaded Tarball

GitHub Repository
Download the awscli.tar.gz file, extract, and install the AWS CLI. When using the following commands, replace the following paths:

C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash with the location of your MSYS2 path.

.\awscli-2.x.x\ with the extracted awscli.tar.gz folder name.

PYTHON='C:\path\to\python.exe' with your local Python path.

The following code example automates building and installing the AWS CLI from PowerShell using MSYS2, and specifies which local install of Python to use:


PS C:\> curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli.tar.gz" -o "awscliv2.zip"  #  Download the awscli.tar.gz file in the current working directory
PS C:\> tar -xvzf .\awscli.tar.gz #  Extract awscli.tar.gz file
PS C:\> cd .\awscli-2.x.x\ #  Navigate to the root of the extracted files
PS C:\> $env:CHERE_INVOKING = 'yes' #  Preserve the current working directory
PS C:\> C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash  -lc " PYTHON='C:\path\to\python.exe' ./configure --prefix='C:\Program Files\AWSCLI' --with-download-deps " 
PS C:\> C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash  -lc "make"
PS C:\> C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash  -lc "make install"
PS C:\> $Env:PATH +=";C:\Program Files\AWSCLI\bin\"
PS C:\> aws --version
aws-cli/2.27.41 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 source-sandbox/AMD64
Alpine Linux container
Below is an example Dockerfile that can be used to get a working installation of the AWS CLI in an Alpine Linux container as an alternative to pre-built binaries for Alpine. When using this example, replace AWSCLI_VERSION with you desired AWS CLI version number:


FROM python:3.8-alpine AS builder

ENV AWSCLI_VERSION=2.10.1

RUN apk add --no-cache \
    curl \
    make \
    cmake \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    libc-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    openssl-dev \
    && curl https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-${AWSCLI_VERSION}.tar.gz | tar -xz \
    && cd awscli-${AWSCLI_VERSION} \
    && ./configure --prefix=/opt/aws-cli/ --with-download-deps \
    && make \
    && make install

FROM python:3.8-alpine

RUN apk --no-cache add groff

COPY --from=builder /opt/aws-cli/ /opt/aws-cli/

ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/aws-cli/bin/aws"]
This image is built and the AWS CLI invoked from a container similar to the one that is built on Amazon Linux 2:


$ docker build --tag awscli-alpine .
$ docker run --rm -it awscli-alpine --version
aws-cli/2.2.1 Python/3.8.11 Linux/5.10.25-linuxkit source-sandbox/x86_64.alpine.3 prompt/off
The final size of this image is smaller than the size of the official AWS CLI Docker image. For information on the official Docker image, see Running the official Amazon ECR Public or Docker images for the AWS CLI.

Troubleshooting AWS CLI install and uninstall errors

For troubleshooting steps for install errors, see Troubleshooting errors for the AWS CLI for common troubleshooting steps. For the most relevant troubleshooting steps, see Command not found errors, The "aws --version" command returns a different version than you installed, and The "aws --version" command returns a version after uninstalling the AWS CLI.

For any issues not covered in the troubleshooting guides, search the issues with the source-distribution label in the AWS CLI Repository on GitHub. If no existing issues cover your errors, create a new issue to receive help from the AWS CLI maintainers.

Next steps

After installing the AWS CLI, you should perform a Setting up the AWS CLI.
